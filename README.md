# tours-system
Intelligent tourist system, the application has several modules such as the login,administration, visit, destination, and feedback-related functionalities. The visit module manages all the travel bookings of the users, and the feedback module, enables clients to post their feedback on experiences at every destination.

This application establishes a link between a location's visits, tourists, and tourism attractions. The program features API services that hold tourist information for each location in a nation, state, city, or province as fixed and dynamic enum data in a Python collection. Each user or visitor also receives a simulation of a mini-reservation process. This prototype will serve as a solid foundation for a microservice architecture inspired by travelogues that may be used in enterprises that cater to tourists. 
This program makes use of the Python 3.8-powered FastAPI framework.
